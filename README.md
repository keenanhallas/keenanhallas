### About Me

My name's Keenan and I'm a recent Lambda School - Full Stack Web Development graduate with 14 years of work experience demonstrating skills in remote work, interpersonal relations, and project management. I'm a results-driven and customer-focused developer who is eager to continue learning and works well as a supportive team player. I contribute an open mind, a sounding board for ideas and problem-solving input to any team or colleague. I'm willing to take ownership of any task assigned. I really enjoy working with the frontend and am interested in learning to usr CSS and HTML in new and experimental ways to create dynamic sites that display visual information in a way that truly draws people in. But I enjoy working on the backend as well, and can't wait to learn more about the backend and databases in a professional job setting. When I'm not coding, I enjoy biking, playing music, studying Spanish, reading, writing, and drawing.
