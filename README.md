### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Keenan Hallas and I'm a software developer about to graduate from Lambda School. I'm looking forward to getting into the industry and starting the next step of my softwate development journey!

### About Me
â€¢ I really enjoy working with the frontend and am interested in using CSS and HTML in new and experimental ways to create dynamic sites that display visual information in a way that truly draws people in
â€¢ But I enjoy working on the backend as well, and can't wait to learn more about professional backends and DBs on the job
â€¢ When I'm not coding, I enjoy biking, playing music, studying Spanish, reading, writing, and drawing.

### Skills
â€¢ HTML/CSS/Javascript
â€¢ React
â€¢ Node.js
â€¢ Express
